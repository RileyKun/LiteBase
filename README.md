# LiteBase-TF2
Because Lak3's base smells like cheese  

NOTE: This base is very old, but you might just be able to get around with it.  

## How to use?
Download Visual Studio 2022.  
You may either download the source from the download button or run this command in a terminal:  
`git clone https://github.com/RileyKun/LiteBase.git`
